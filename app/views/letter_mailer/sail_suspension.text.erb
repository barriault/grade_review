Dear <%= @student.first_name %>,


As a S.A.I.L. student this summer, you were required to maintain at least a 2.0 GPR in your classes, have no failing grades (including CAEX classes), and obey all University student rules in order to be fully admitted to Texas A&M University at Galveston for the Fall <%= Date.today.strftime("%Y") %> semester.  Since you did not fulfill these requirements, you are not eligible to enroll at Texas A&M University at Galveston this fall.

Our department will drop your schedule as well as any fee options.  If you received a fall housing assignment to live on campus this fall, you must contact Residence Life at (409) 740-4469 to make arrangements to remove any belongings left in the residence halls from the Summer term and request a refund of your housing deposit.  (We have already notified Residential Services concerning your room assignment.)  If you have belongings in the residence halls, you must contact the housing office immediately.

You will not be eligible to return to Texas A&M University at Galveston until the Fall semester of <%= Date.next_year %>.  If you would like to return, you must do the following:
      -  Meet the readmission guidelines specified by your desired major.
      -  Set a minimum goal of a 3.00 GPR in most recent semester courses taken (not including summer).
      -  Complete no less than 12 graded, transferable hours on most recent semester courses taken
         (not including summer).
      -  Coursework must consist of three and four hour courses (and should reflect requirements for
         your desired major).
      -  Complete the application process for readmission, including all necessary transcripts, by 
         August 1st of the year you plan to reenter.

I wish you success in your educational endeavors.


Sincerely,


Dr. Donna C. Lang
Vice President
Texas A&M University at Galveston
