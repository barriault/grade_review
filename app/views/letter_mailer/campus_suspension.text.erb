Dear <%= @student.first_name %>,


Upon receipt of your final grade report, your academic record was reviewed at the departmental and institutional level.  Your grade point ratio is below the minimum level required to maintain satisfactory scholastic standing at the Galveston Campus placing you on Galveston Campus Suspension. In effect, you will be dropped from your <%= @student.term.probation_term %> classes and a hold has been placed on your registration.

You are designated on suspension from the Texas A&M University at Gavleston Campus for (1) full semester <%= @student.term.probation_term %>.  During this time, you are required to develop an action plan addressing the specific issues causing you academic difficulty.  After the semester suspension concludes, you will be required to reapply to the campus.  Readmission to the university is not guaranteed.  

You may apply for readmission to Teaxas A&M University at Galveston for an academic term that begins after the completion of your term suspension.  Additional information on the application process for readmission is available from the Office of Admissions website (www.tamug.edu/admrc).  All readmission applications will be reviewed, but readmission is not guaranteed.  Factors considered in readmission decisions include GPA at Texas A&M, GPA coursework completed since leaving Texas A&M, desired major, and information presented in the application.

You are responsible for learning TAMUG academic rules.  Review academic rules and their important details at www.tamug.edu/stulife/studentrules.html.
