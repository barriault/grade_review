Dear <%= @student.first_name %>, 


Upon receipt of your final grade report, your academic record was reviewed at the departmental and institutional level. Since your grade point ratio is below the minimum level required to maintain satisfactory scholastic standing, you will be placed on Scholastic Probation for the <%= @student.term.probation_term %> semester and until your grade point ratio becomes satisfactory.

Scholastic Probation constitutes conditional permission to continue in the University after having become scholastically deficient. You are responsible for learning TAMUG academic rules. Review academic rules and their important details at www.tamug.edu/stulife/studentrules.html. At the end of the <%= @student.term.probation_term %> semester, your semester and cumulative grade point ratio must be equal to or greater than 2.0.  If you do not meet the terms of your scholastic probation your continued enrollment will be in jeopardy.

Please note that some departments/majors require a higher GPR to meet degree requirements, therefore we HIGHLY recommend examining your academic performance with an academic advisor. You may need to adjust your <%= @student.term.probation_term %> schedule to accommodate unfilled pre-requisites and required course repeats. An advisor can assess your progress and help you develop a plan for moving forward. Please find a list of department contact info below. 

We look forward to supporting you in fulfilling your academic goals. In addition to academic advising, the following TAMUG resources may be helpful:
  *Office of Counseling and Career Services - learning disabilities, test anxiety, personal issues, health, career placement, etc.
  *Office of Academic Enhancement - general advising, academic coaching, success workshops, supplemental instruction, tutoring, etc.
  *Writing Lab - assignment editing, research, literacy, citations, workshops, etc.
  *Applied Mathematics Laboratory - math homework assistance and group study sessions
  *Office of Residence Life - student activities, housing
  *Office of Student Life - student organizations, culture and diversity, recreational sports, etc.

The faculty and I are deeply interested in your scholastic progress at Texas A&M at Galveston. We hope that you will make every effort during the next semester to meet the terms of your probation. Should you have any questions concerning your probationary status, please contact the head of your academic department. Please know that I am also available if you need.



Sincerely,


Dr. Donna C. Lang
Associate Vice President
Texas A&M University at Galveston
