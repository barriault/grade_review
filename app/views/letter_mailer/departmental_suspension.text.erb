Dear <%= @student.first_name %>,


Upon receipt of your final grade report, your academic record was reviewed at the departmental and institutional level.  Your grade point ratio is below the minimum level required to maintain satisfactory scholastic standing in your major.

At this time, you will be dropped from your <%= @student.term.probation_term %> “major” classes and your major will be changed to General Academics (GACD) pending further discussion.  It is critical for you to examine your choice of major and your academic performance.  You may choose to pursue other majors at Texas A&M University at Galveston this spring or remain in GACD until you have more time to explore your options.  We do not recommend for you to stay in an undeclared status longer than one semester.  If you need assistance to adjust your <%= @student.term.probation_term %> schedule, please contact the department you plan to pursue or the General Academics department (listed below).

Please look carefully at your grades on your Howdy portal.  I recommend using the unofficial transcript to review your entire history.  The primary function of this review is to help guide you to keep moving toward your degree and your goals.

Resources that may be of support to you:

  * Meet with your academic advisor in your major or discuss options with another major department.
  * Meet with Office of Counseling (learning disabilities, test anxiety, personal issues, veteran services, substance abuse, wellness and more).
  * Attend the Office of Academic Enhancement Right Academic Start Workshop to learn how to use the on-line resource “Academic Success”.
  * Meet with Career Planning and Placement (choose or refocus on your major).

The faculty and I are deeply interested in your scholastic progress at Texas A&M at Galveston.  Should you have any questions concerning your probationary status, please contact the head of your academic department.  Please know that I am also available if you need.


Sincerely,


Dr. Donna C. Lang
Vice President
Texas A&M University at Galveston
