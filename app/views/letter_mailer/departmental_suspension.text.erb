Dear <%= @student.first_name %>,


Upon receipt of your final grade report, your academic record was reviewed at the departmental and institutional level.  Your grade point ratio is below the minimum level required to maintain satisfactory scholastic standing in your major. In effect, you will be dropped from your <%= @student.term.probation_term %> "major" classes and your major will be changed to General Academics (GACD) pending further discussion.

You are responsible for learning TAMUG academic rules. Review academic rules and their important details at www.tamug.edu/stulife/studentrules.html.

We HIGHLY recommend examining your choice of major and your academic performance with an academic advisor.  You may choose to pursue other majors at Texas A&M University at Galveston this <%= @student.term.probation_term %> or remain in GACD until you have more time to explore your options.  Please find a list of department contact info, including General Academics, below.

We look forward to supporting you in fulfilling your academic goals.  In addition to academic advising, the following TAMUG resources may be helpful:

  *Office of Counseling and Career Services - learning disabilities, test anxiety, personal issues, health, career placement, etc.
  *Office of Academic Enhancement - general advising, academic coaching, success workshops, supplemental instruction, tutoring, etc.
  *Writing Lab - assignment editing, research, literacy, citations, workshops, etc.
  *Applied Mathematics Laboratory - math homework assistance and group study sessions
  *Office of Residence Life - student activities, housing
  *Office of Student Life - student organizations, culture and diversity, recreational sports, etc.

The faculty and I are deeply interested in your scholastic progress at Texas A&M at Galveston.  Should you have any questions concerning your probationary status, please contact the head of your academic department.  Please know that I am also available if you need.


Sincerely,


Dr. Donna C. Lang
Associate Vice President
Texas A&M University at Galveston
